You can share and store images in Docker Hub ([http://hub.docker.com](http://hub.docker.com)). Docker hub has over 100,000 images created by developers that you can run locally. You can search for Docker Hub images and run them directly from Docker Desktop.

## Step 1: Search for the image

You can search for Docker Hub images on Docker Desktop. Use the search bar, or use the shortcut âŒ˜K on Mac or Ctrl + K on Windows. In the search, specify `welcome-to-docker` to find the `docker/welcome-to-docker` image you'll use in this guide.

## Step 2: Run the image

To run the `docker/welcome-to-docker` image, select **Run**. When the **Optional settings** appear, specify the **Host port** number `8090` and then select **Run**.

> **Note**
>
> Many images hosted on Docker Hub have a description that highlights what settings must be set in order to run them. You can read the description for the image on Docker Hub by selecting **View on Hub** or by searching for the image directly on [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

## Step 3: Explore the container

That's it! The container is ready to use. Go to the **Containers** tab in Docker Desktop to view the container.

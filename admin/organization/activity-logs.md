Activity logs display a chronological list of activities that occur at organization and repository levels.

With activity logs, owners can view and track:

- What changes were made
- The date when a change was made
- Who initiated the change

For example, activity logs display activities such as the date when a repository was created or deleted, the user who created the repository, the name of the repository, and when there was a change to the privacy settings.

Owners can also see the activity logs for their repository if the repository is part of the organization subscribed to a Docker plan.

1. Sign in to [Docker Admin](https://admin.docker.com).
2. In **Organizations**, select an organization in .
3. Navigate to **Activity** > **Activity Logs**.

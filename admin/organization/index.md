An organization in Docker is a collection of teams and repositories that you manage together. A team is a group of Docker users that belong to an organization. An organization can have multiple teams.

Docker users become members of an organization when an organization owner assigns them to at least one team in the organization. When you first create an organization, you have one team, the owners team, that has a single member. An organization owner is someone that's part of the owners team. They can create new teams and add members to an existing team using their Docker ID or email address and by selecting a team the user should be part of. An organization owner can also add additional owners to help them manage users, teams, and repositories in the organization.

You can create an organization in Docker Hub. For details about creating an organization, see
[Create an organization](../../docker-hub/orgs.md#create-an-organization).
